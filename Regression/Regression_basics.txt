Regression:
  -It is a technique employed in supervised learning and used mostly with numpers and structured data from the database.
  -There are two types of variables in Regression
    *Dependent Variables(These variables can be seen as state||traget||output & The Data should be continous) Notation = Y
    *Indipendent Variables(Causes of those states) Notation = X
Types of regression models:
  -Simple Regression (one InDependent variable is used to predict a Dependent variable)
    *Simple Linear Regression (pridecting co2emission vs EngineSize)
    *Simple Non-Linear Regression
  -Multiple Linear Regression(More than one InDependent variable is used to predict a Dependent variable):
    *Multiple Linear Regression
    *Multiple Non-Linear Regression
    
Applications:
  *Sales forecasting
  *Price Estimation
  *Employment income

Diffrent Regression Techniques:
  -Ordinal regression
  -Poisson Regression
  -Fast Forest quantile regression
  -Linear , Polynomial , Lasso ,Stepwise , Ridge regression
  -Bayesian Linear Regression
  -Neural Network Regression
  -Desicion Forest Regression
  -Boosted Desicion Tree regression
  -KNN(K-nearesr Neighbours)
