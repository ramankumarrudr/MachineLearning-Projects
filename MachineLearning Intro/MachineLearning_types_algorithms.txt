Popular Machine Learning Techniques:
  
  -Regression/Estimation: Is used in predicting continous values based on its charachteristics. ex - co2 emission from cars
    
  -Classification : Predicting items class/category of a case
  
  -Clustering : Used as segmentation technique for unsupervised learning
  
  -Associations: Finding Items that frequenty occur or co-occur. Ex - Predict the items bought in grosery shop
  
  -Anomaly detection: Discovering Abnormal cases. Ex Atm fraud detection
  
  -Sequence Mining: Predicting next event in stream(Markov Model,HMM)
  
  -Dimension Reduction: To reduce the size of the data.
  
  -Recmmendation Systems:TO suggest relevent books and movies

AI(Makes computers intelligent by mimicing the human intalligence):
  -Computer Vision
  -Language Processing
  -Creativity
ML(Learn From data):
  -Classification
  -Clustering
  -Neural Network
Deep Learning(Complex Layers and deeper level of algorithms):
  -Reinforcement Learning

Supervised and Unsupervised Machine learning:
  *Supervised Learning - Needs to have knowledge of the data to detect patterns
    Techniques Employed:
      -Classification 
      -Regression
  *Unsupervised Learning - Needs to find patters of the data by its own
    Techniques Employed:
      -Clustering
